Summary
---------

A Bootstrap-y, pretty index.html designed to be placed at the root of a public Amazon S3 bucket, which
you just want to use for displaying a list of files. I have added some styling and adjusted the URL according to my requirements.

Usage
-------

Just place the index.html file in the root of your bucket.  It'll look [like this][1].

For comparison, the [original index.html created by Amazon][2] looks [like this][3].
